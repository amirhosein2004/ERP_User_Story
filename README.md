# User Story Module

This project implements a module based on a User Story, following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. The primary goal is to design and implement the domain models, create corresponding serializers, and expose CRUD APIs for the `Project` entity.

---

## Core Objectives

-   **Domain Model Design**: Create models based on the [ERP User Story Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ux4XD_B3t8Sx1ROxpOELFGJVP66pYXMp3bQxzxzYCdo/edit?tab=t.0).
-   **API Implementation**: Develop full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for projects using Django REST Framework `ViewSet`.
-   **Serialization**: Design appropriate serializers for data input and output.
-   **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation for the API, including endpoints and a Postman collection.
